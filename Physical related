So once you completed level 1 (hardware related) you are now ready for physical related safety, im also gonna drop some street smart knowledge on here.

Ok so rule n1; never have more than one device on you. Police can miss match any info from devices to identify your persona with different identites you have previously created, giving your efforts up and possibly
getting you arrested and charged.

CONVENIENTLY police officers put an extra effort on fucking you up when it comes to cybercrimes so be carefull, like REALLY carefull.

IF  YOU  GET  ARRESTED:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Do not say anything other than "no comment" and "allegedly", I repeat Do Not say anything other than "no comment" and "allegedly" ( taking this approach when in legal situations if you are the deffendant is key)
Once you enter jail make yourself respected because you are basically in a playground so make the most out of it bc in federal prison having a tough rep from jail could be helpfull.
Always stick to your own race socially and verbally even if you are still in jail or in the station. It shows that you arent a newbie  and tat you know what's up.
Now once you enter prison you can take a few approaches but ima teach you two:

1. You be humble but make yourself respected when needed, moving in your own car and putting in the work when neccesary

2. For this approach you will need a few buddies. First you arrive, get checked, and your'e charges are clean (hopefully). So you get with your car. You will observe all guards and workers in the prison.
Why? you may ask welll you are looking for weakness bc you my friend are gonna extort them for benefits, Such as smuggling, extra commisary. And this is where your buddies come in clutch, you will find out
their full name, then your buddies do the rest. By doing this you will gain respect and power BUT remember to ask for permission from the one who has got the keys, you dont want no extra trouble for this
"Also please make it so that nobody knows when you are getting out"
