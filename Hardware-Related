First off you want to get your hands on a computer, preferably a laptop for portability, you will also need a cell phone to be able to comunicate and provide internet connection to the computer. You will also need some
faraday pouches, cases or whatever you can get your hands on. Keep in mind none of the things you are going to need can have any type of connection to you, ABSOLUTELY NONE!!
Okay first we start with the cell phone, you will not let it be active while arround your home or any personal devices, so you only take it out of the faraday pouch while being far from any personal stuff, including cars,
homes, computers, wifi... You will get something sharp and will break the camera and the microphone while being extra careful to not break the entire cellphone, now this may not be the best way to disable any possible spying
it is the most effective and fast. Now we will de Googalize our phones( you can prefferably get a phone that comes de googalized) by installing another os or by stripping it ourselves manually.




Just started this.... haha we are just getting started. Im planning to make this a whole library where you can enter a noobie and exit as an agency ghost.
