First off you want to get your hands on a computer, preferably a laptop for portability, you will also need a cell phone to be able to comunicate and provide internet connection to the computer. You will also need some
faraday pouches, cases or whatever you can get your hands on. Keep in mind none of the things you are going to need can have any type of connection to you, ABSOLUTELY NONE!!( so pay cash and wear a hoodie or something)
Okay first we start with the cell phone, you will not let it be active while arround your home or any personal devices, so you only take it out of the faraday pouch while being far from any personal stuff, including cars,
homes, computers, wifi... You will get something sharp and will break the camera and the microphone while being extra careful to not break the entire cellphone, now this may not be the best way to disable any possible spying
it is the most effective and fast. Now we will de Googalize our phones( you can prefferably get a phone that comes de googalized) by installing another os or by stripping it ourselves manually.




Just started this.... haha we are just getting started. Im planning to make this a whole library where you can enter a noobie and exit as an agency ghost, or sum like that haha.

DAY 2!!

Ok now that you have 2 devices that arent linked to you in any way you must be sure to not have them available when in proximity of your personal devices for example: entering your neighbourhood? faraday patch,
if  you keep more than one device toghether? only one available, the rest in faraday bags. PLEASE FOLLOW THESE LIKE THE GOSPEL::::
When using any device that has acces to internet i reccoment to use a vpn because why not... Stick only to Proton and Mullvad.

"At this point you are more than safe for regular people stuff like online banking, crypto or anything similar.  anything past this overcomes the 80 20 rule.

Hence you are at a good level on hardware related safety measures we will go to physical and street safety related.
